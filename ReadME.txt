The goal of the game is to collect as many pickups (nuclear waste) as possible.
In this prototype, the game does not have a winning condition yet, but it will be added in the final game.

You will die and respawn to the starting point if you fall from the platform or touches the enemies.
The red ball enemy will chase you if you are inside its sight range. Use crouch to stealth and avoid its detection.

To control the player:
W: forward
A: left
S: back
D: right
C: crouch (stealth)
Shift: sprint
Space: jump
Mouse movement: Camera control
