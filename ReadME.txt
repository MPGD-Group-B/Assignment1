You are a sea scientist and the goal of the game is to collect pickups (nuclear waste) to save the ocean. 

You will die and respawn to the check point if you fall from the platform or touches the enemies.
Be careful, jelly fish and sharks are mutated creatures that might kill you. Use crouch to hide yourself
from the shark.

To control the player:
W: forward
A: left
S: back
D: right
C: crouch (stealth)
Shift: sprint
Space: jump
Mouse movement: Camera control

Press Space in air after jumping can perform double jump.

The game contains 1 tutorial level and 2 main levels.
